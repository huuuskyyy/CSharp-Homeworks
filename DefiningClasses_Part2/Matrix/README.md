Define a class Matrix<T> to hold a matrix of numbers (e.g. integers, floats, decimals). 
Implement an indexer this[row, col] to access the inner matrix cells.
Implement the operators + and - (addition and subtraction of matrices of the same size) and * for matrix multiplication. Throw an exception when the operation cannot be performed. Implement the true operator (check for non-zero elements).
