<b>1. Write a program based on dynamic programming to solve the "Knapsack Problem": you are given N products, each has weight Wi and costs Ci and a knapsack of capacity M and you want to put inside a subset of the products with highest cost and weight ≤ M. The numbers N, M, Wi and Ci are integers in the range [1..500]. </br>Example: M=10 kg, N=6, products:
</br>beer – weight=3, cost=2
</br>vodka – weight=8, cost=12
</br>cheese – weight=4, cost=5
</br>nuts – weight=1, cost=4
</br>ham – weight=2, cost=3
</br>whiskey – weight=8, cost=13</b>
