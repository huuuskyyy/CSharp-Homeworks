<b>Write a program to calculate the "Minimum Edit Distance" (MED) between two words. MED(x, y) is the minimal sum of costs of edit operations used to transform x to y. Sample costs are given below:
</br>cost (replace a letter) = 1
</br>cost (delete a letter) = 0.9
</br>cost (insert a letter) = 0.8
</br>Example: x = "developer", y = "enveloped" -> cost = 2.7 
</br>delete ‘d’:  "developer" -> "eveloper", cost = 0.9
</br>insert ‘n’:  "eveloper" -> "enveloper", cost = 0.8
</br>replace ‘r’  ‘d’:  "enveloper" -> "enveloped", cost = 1
